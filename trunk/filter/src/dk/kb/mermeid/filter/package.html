    <h1>xml_store <kbd>filter</kbd></h1>

    <p><kbd>filter</kbd> is a supporting web application to the mermeid MEI
    editing system. The two most important functions is to transform documents
    in between the editor and an XML CRUD engine. It supports HTTP
    <kbd>GET</kbd> and <kbd>PUT</kbd>.</p>

    <p>It offers full CRUD support through three servlets</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
	<th>Create</th>
	<td>dk.kb.mermeid.filter.NewFileServlet</td>
	<td>Supports GET and PUT.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Retrieve, Update</th>
	<td>dk.kb.mermeid.filter.HttpFilter</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Delete</th>
	<td>dk.kb.mermeid.filter.DeleteServlet</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Create using GET</h2>

    <p>Typically a new document is created by POSTing it to a CRUD engine. It
    will assign a name to the document and store it. eXist XML database does
    do this. Instead we have ensured that the mermeid form can survive an edit
    request for a named non-existing document. The NewFileServlet creates new
    unique file names and redirects a client to a form editing such a
    document. After the user has completed the editing, the form PUTs the
    content through filter to the database.</p>

    <h2>Retrieval using GET</h2>

    <p>Retrieves the document from the XML store and, XSL transforms it by
    means of an XSLT scripts named in a JAVA and finally it delivers it to an
    HTTP client</p>

    <p>filter parses the request, and will assume that the string after the
    last slash ('/') is an unique file name (or really a record ID) that can
    be used for retrieval in the XML database. The string between the two last
    slashes is regarded as the database name. I.e.:</p>

    <pre>
      http://example.org/context/&lt;database name&gt;/&lt;record ID&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>Update using PUT</h2>

    <p>filter accepts PUT requests to any URI. It will XSL transform the
    content and save it into the database.</p>

    <p>Requests are parsed exactly as for GET requests</p>

    <h2>Deleting using GET</h2>

    <p>Ordinary browsers do not support HTTP DELETE request. We think that is
    good. The eXist XML database do, however. filter can delete documents by
    sending a DELETE request an URI corresponding to a GET request from a user
    client. The DeleteServlet is basically a GET to DELETE gateway.</p>
