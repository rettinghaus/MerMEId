<h2>Working with relations: Creating a music anthology</h2>
<p>A distinction should be made between anthologies regarded as
one work and anthologies regarded as a collection of individual works.
For instance, a song cycle may be regarded as one work or not,
depending on the circumstances, the project's aim etc. The decision
implies different workflows.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anthologies regarded as one work</strong>
are simply works with a number of constituent components, and they are
treated just like any other work with a number of movements. The
components are defined at the <span class="music tab">Music</span>
tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Near the bottom of the page, create the desired number of
components using the <img src="../images/add.gif" alt="Add">
add buttons.</li>
<li>Save your work and start editing the components one at a
time by clicking the component's <img src="../images/edit.gif" alt="Edit"> edit button.</li>
<li>Enter the details about the component, such as the title
and the text author.</li>
<li>Click the "save and close" button to save your work and
return to the <span class="music tab">Music</span>
tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anthologies of individual works</strong>
are a little more complicated. They can be created as separate works
(files), linked together by work-to-work relations:</p>
<p><img src="../images/manual/anthology_song_cycle.png" alt="work-to-work relations"></p>
<ul>
<li>First, create and save the individual works. However,
sources representing the entire anthology should not be defined at this
stage.</li>
<li>Then, create another work to represent the anthology. At
the <span class="work tab">Work</span> tab, start
defining relations to the contained works by clicking the "Add
relation" button.</li>
<li>Select the "has part:" relation ("part" in this case is not
to be understood musically).<br>
<img src="../images/manual/anthology_relation.png" alt="create a work-to-work relation" class="illustration">
</li>
<li>Open the works browser by clicking the "Select file..."
button. In the works browser, locate and click the desired work.<br>
It may be convenient to narrow the search to a specific file collection
or enter search terms such as the title. <br>
Please note that the file browser may need some time to load and to
update.<br>
<img src="../images/manual/anthology_work_selection.png" alt="works browser" class="illustration"><br>
(If you know the work's file name, you may also enter it as the <em>target</em>
attribute using the <a href="attribute_editor.html">attribute
editor</a>). </li>
<li>Repeat this with each of the contained works and save your
work. You should end up with something like this:<br>
<img src="../images/manual/anthology_relations.png" alt="work-to-work relations" class="illustration"> </li>
<li>Add any other desired information about the anthology, such
as title, source descriptions etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that relations are bidirectional. In order to create
links both ways (from the anthology to the individual works and back),
edit each of the contained works to add a relation back to the
anthology. You have easy access to the contained works (and back)
clicking the "Go to linked resource" icon <img src="../images/go_to_link.png" alt="Go to linked resource">.</p>
<p>In the HTML preview, the result could look something like the
following:</p>
