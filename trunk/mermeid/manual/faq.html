    <h2>Installation and access </h2>
    <h3>Can I install MerMEId on my laptop?<a name="laptop_installation"></a></h3>
    <p>In principle, yes. Please note, however, that MerMEId is a web application, not a desktop
      application. This means that it needs a web server to run; the user interacts with MerMEId
      through a web browser. It also means that installation requires the skills of a system
      administrator to set up all the components of the web server. Technically, it is possible to
      do it on a laptop, but usually that's not advisable, because your installation and your data
      wouldn't be accessible from any other machine. Also, if your laptop crashes or is stolen, you
      are likely to lose your data. Installation on a proper web server located at your institution
      gives you much better data protection, and not least: You will be able to use MerMEId and
      access your data from any computer that has access to your server. All you need is a web
      browser. </p>
    <h3>Can I use The Royal Library's MerMEId server for our project?<a name="kb_hosting"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>Unfortunately no. The Royal Library's demo installation at <a
        href="http://labs.kb.dk/editor/" target="_blank">labs.kb.dk/editor/</a> is meant for
      demonstration only. The library cannot host other projects' data. You are welcome, on the
      other hand, to use the demo installation to try out MerMEId or even to do preliminary work
      until you have set up your own server. Note, however, that the library does not take any
      responsibility for any loss of data stored on the demo server. The data at the demo server are
      freely accessible for anyone to edit or even delete. If you are doing any serious work there,
      make sure to make local copies of your data frequently (See: How do I copy or move my data
      from one MerMEId instance to another?). We are also likely to clean up the server by deleting
      user data every now and then. If there is something you would like us not to delete please let
      us know. </p>
    <h3>How many MerMEId installations do I need for my project?<a name="number_of_installations"
      ></a>
    </h3>
    <p>Preferably only one. MerMEId is a web application (See: <a href="#laptop_installation">Can I
        install MerMEId on my laptop?</a>), and your data will need to be stored on the same server.
      If you have more than one installation, you will have trouble synchronizing your data across
      MerMEId intances (probably by copying files back and forth manually). </p>
    <h3>How do I copy or move my data from one MerMEId instance to another?<a name="copying_data"
      ></a>
    </h3>
    <p>To move or copy XML data files from one MerMEId installation to another, download your files
      to your hard drive first. You can do so one file at a time by right-clicking (on Windows
      machines) the file's XML icon in the file list and selecting "Save as..." or equivalent. If
      you need to download many files it will probably be easier to use the eXist database's admin
      client. You will need to have administrator access to the database in order to use it. You
      will probably find the adminstration page at http://[yourservername.yourdomain]:8080/exist/.
      Click the 'Collections' option to open the database's file manager which allows you to
      download all or some of your files. You will find your files in the 'dcm' folder. Use the same
      component on another server to upload your data (again, to the 'dcm' folder). </p>
    <h3>What if some day MerMEId is no longer maintained? Will I lose my data?<a
        name="discontinuation"></a></h3>
    <p>No. One of the core ideas of MerMEId is that it produces data compliant to the <a
        href="http://www.music-encoding.org">MEI</a> XML schema â€“ an open, well-documented standard
      for encoding musical information. Basically, MerMEId is simply a user interface to allow you
      to produce MEI XML without having to hand-code everything. You can use other tools such as a
      generic XML editor to do the same, just in a less convenient way. So even without MerMEId, you
      can still have valid MEI XML data and continue your work using other tools. Just make sure
      always to keep a copy of your data somewhere safe. </p>
      <h3>How do I know which MerMEId version is running on my server?<a
        name="version"></a></h3>
      <p>To see the version (revision) number of your installation, open any file in the editor (or create a new one) 
        and click the <img src="../images/mermeid_12px.png" alt="MerMEId logo"/> logo in the lower right corner.</p>
    <h2>HTML preview and presentation of data </h2>
    <h3>Can I change the way MerMEId displays my data?<a name="changing_presentation"></a></h3>
    <p>Yes, you can.   
      MerMEId's basic MEI-to-HTML XSL style sheet, mei_to_html.xsl, is located in the eXist database (in db/style/). By modifying it you may alter 
      the way MerMEId displays your data, or you can make a copy of it to use for your presentation outside 
      of MerMEId. 
      You may also want to download and/or alter the
      corresponding CSS style sheet, mei_to_html.css, found in the same location.<br/>
      If you want to switch between different transformations, you can place custom XSL style sheets 
      in the eXist database (in db/style/) and tell MerMEId which transformation to use by adding a parameter
      ?xsl=[your xsl file name] to the preview URL, like: 
      http://www.example.com/storage/present.xq?xsl=your_style_sheet.xsl<br/>            
      Even though MerMEId can produce HTML to display your data (either by clicking a work's title
      in the file list or by clicking the 'View as HTML' icon in the editor), MerMEId does not tell
      you how to present your data to the public or in any other context. The built-in HTML preview
      is meant for reviewing your data for convenient proofreading etc. <br/>
      You are welcome to re-use or
      alter the XSL style sheet used to create the preview for your public presentation, but more likely
      you will want to define your own. There is no forced connection between the way MerMEIds
      displays your data and the way your final presentation does. In the public version of the <a
        href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank">Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works
        (CNW)</a>, we are using a slightly modified version of MerMEId's HTML preview XSL style sheet 
      to do the basic formatting; we have basically just filtered out
      certain information and linked to a different CSS style sheet.</p>
    <h3>MerMEId does not show some information I have entered. Why?<a name="information_not_shown"
      ></a>
    </h3>
    <p>The built-in HTML preview is designed to display all the information you may enter in the
      editor, with a few exceptions. Some information is very complex to handle; for instance, only
      some of the possible relations between sources, versions etc. are pre-defined to have a
      visible effect in the HTML preview. If you want other relations to have a an effect, you will
      have to define it in your presentation. Finally, there is
      definitely a chance that we have simply forgotten to implement a certain feature in the HTML
      preview because we haven't used it yet. Please let us know if something is missing. </p>
    <h2>Using the editor </h2>
    <h3>How do I start a new file collection or catalogue?<a name="start_a_collection"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>You may have noticed the use of 'Collection' names in MerMEId's file list, for instance,
      'MerMEId Demo'. The collection names are intended to enable you to distinguish or select files
      belonging to a certain catalogue in your database. This makes it possible to have any number
      of catalogues in the same database. To make your file part of a specific catalogue or
      collection, open the file in the editor, go to the 'File' tab, and enter the collection name
      in the field labeled 'File Collection' under 'Series' (and save your work, of course). In the
      file list, you will now see the collection name in the 'Collection' column, and it will also
      appear in the collection drop-down list, allowing you to search for files in that collection
      only.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>How do I make MerMEId recognize a certain number as a catalogue work number?<a
        name="add_work_number"></a></h3>
    <p>You may have noticed that the demo files in MerMEId's file list are labeled like'MerMEId Demo
      3' in the 'Collection' column. To make MerMEId recognize a number as the work's or file's
      number in your collection (equivalent to the numbers in the BWV, for instance), go to the
      'Work' tab, add a work identifier (under 'Identifier'), enter the file collection's name as
      the list name and the desired number in the 'No.' field. If MerMEId finds a work identifier
      corresponding to the file collection defined at the 'File' tab, it regards the identifier's
      number as the catalogue number.</p>
    <h2>Customizing the MerMEId editor</h2>
    <h3>Can I add fields to the editor form or alter existing ones?<a name="customize"></a></h3>
    <p>In principle yes, if you know how to write <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/" target="_blank"
        >Orbeon XForms</a>. You will find the MerMEId source code at <a
        href="https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You
      are free to change it to make your&nbsp;customized version of MerMEId. However, note that this
      will require you to make the same changes again after installing one of our&nbsp;MerMEId
      updates. Also, MerMEId is based on sharing. No one else will&nbsp;benefit from your changes if
      you keep them for yourself. Therefore we would like to encourage you to share your
      improvements either by forking the code at GitHub and submitting a pull request or to discuss
      your wishes with us; if we agree that the changes will be of general interest, we may be
      willing to implement them if&nbsp;we have the time. Another possibility is&nbsp;to pay us
      (that is, the <a href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/">Danish Centre for Music Editing</a> at
      the Royal Library) to make the desired improvements. That's a great way to support the MerMEId
      project.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Can I change the pre-defined instrument names?<a name="customize_instruments"></a></h3>
    <p>Yes. The simplest way is to manually change the text MerMEId inserts in every instance. The
      more efficient way is to change the&nbsp;instrument name list (instruments.xml), which
      is&nbsp;kept in the eXist database in a folder named 'Library' together with&nbsp;other lists
      for more convenient customization. Ask your system administrator about how to access and edit
      the files. The structure of the&nbsp;files should be pretty self-explanatory.</p>
    <h3>The authority file I use is not listed. Can I add it?<a name="add_authorities"></a></h3>
    <p>Yes. You can edit the list the same way you would <a href="faq.html#customize_instruments"
        >change pre-defined instruments names</a>.</p>
    <h3>How do I make MerMEId recognize other abbreviations?<a name="add_abbreviations"></a></h3>
    <p>The same way you would <a href="#customize_instruments">change pre-defined instruments
        names</a>.</p>
    <h3>How do I change the genre keywords in the 'Keywords' menu?<a name="change_genres"></a></h3>
    <p>The same way you would <a href="faq.html#customize_instruments">change pre-defined
        instruments names</a>. The keyword file ('keywords.xml') has two sections: first,&nbsp;a
      list of hierarchically ordered keywords (called 'level 1' and 'level 2' terms); second,&nbsp;a
      list of unordered supplementary keywords. The two-level ordered list of genre terms is useful
      if you intend to order your files by genre at some point or enable users to browse your
      catalogue by genre. That's how we generated the genre menu in the <a
        href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank">CNW</a>.</p>
    <h2>Publishing</h2>
    <h3>I have published a file from the file list, but nothing happens&nbsp;except that the
      'Publish' indicator turns green. What is supposed to happen?<a name="publishing"></a></h3>
    <p>There's no way we can predict how and where you want to publish your data. By default,
      therefore,&nbsp;MerMEId does nothing but copying the selected file(s) from an eXist database
      folder&nbsp;named 'dcm' (where all your data are stored) to another folder&nbsp;named
      'public'. It is up to you or your system administrator to decide what is going to happen next.
      At DCM, we have set up a script that automatically copies all files from the 'public' folder
      through the firewall to the published catalog on the web once a day. The script is not part of
      MerMEId, but you are welcome to contact us if you would like to know in detail how it works. </p>
    <h3>I would like to make a web catalog like the CNW. Is the user interface included in
        MerMEId?<a name="cnw_ui"></a></h3>
    <p>No. MerMEId is&nbsp;a tool for creating and editing the XML data for a catalogue of works or
      sources, not a presentation tool. We're quite sure that every project will want to have their
      data presented in their own way, so we haven't made our presentation part of MerMEId. To
      create the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html" target="_blank">public CNW</a>
      catalogue, we basically use MerMEId's&nbsp;MEI-to-HTML transformation, and add a few exceptions
      and alterations on top of it. We have&nbsp;added a few XQuery&nbsp;files for the search
      facilities and a couple of flat HTML files for the text-only pages. A few more XQuery scripts
      wrap the pages with a header and a footer. We are happy to share the code with you if you
      like.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <h3>How do I stay informed about changes and updates?<a name="updates"></a></h3>
    <p>We recommend that you sign up for MerMEId news. There's a subscription form at <a
        href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid.html" target="_blank">DCM's MerMEId
        project page</a> (in the right column). Don't worry â€“ we will not flood your inbox with
      mails. We will send a mail only when releasing major upgrades or if there are other important
      MerMEId-related&nbsp;announcements. <br /> A list of important information about
      releases,&nbsp;transformation of data, and known issues is compiled at <a
        href="http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid/" target="_blank"
        >http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/projekter/mermeid/</a>.<br /> Finally, you may also want to
      follow the discussions about the development of the MEI schema&nbsp;which defines the
      structure of the (meta-)data produced by MerMEId. The MEI community even has a <a
        href="http://music-encoding.org/community/mei-organization/interest-groups-ig/"
        target="_blank">special interest group concerned with cataloging and metadata</a> with its
      own mailing list where discussions regarding the encoding of musical metadata take place.
      Important MerMEId&nbsp;announcements will be posted there as well.</p>
