      <h2>Using external sources – linking to and copying from sources in other files</h2>
      <h3>Referring to source descriptions in other files</h3>
      <p>A source shared by a number of files does not have to be
        described in each file, duplicating the information about it. Instead,
        the source description in one file may be retrieved by other files.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/manual/external_source.png" alt="Using an external source"></p>
      <p>In the above example, the works X and Y, located in separate
        files, are sharing the source C. Work X, however, only has a
        placeholder for the source C, retrieving the actual source description
        from work Y. <br>
          Assuming that you already have the source description you want to link
          to (i.e. work Y in the example above), follow these steps to indicate
          that source information for work X is to be retrieved from an external
          file: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create or open for editing the work that will be using the
          external source (i.e. work X in the example)</li>
        <li>At the <span class="source tab">Source</span>
          tab, create a new source by clicking an existing source's <img src="../images/add.gif" alt="Add"> add button (if
            there are no sources defined yet, you will need to create a regular
            source first, as external source linking is - for now - available only
            from add buttons next to an existing source; this has purely technical
            reasons. Once you have created the external source link, you may delete
            the empty source created first).</li>
        <li>From the menu, choose "Add link to external source"<br>
          <img src="../images/manual/external_source_add.png" alt="Add link" class="illustration"></li>
        <li>This opens the source browser. It lists all works having
          sources. You may limit the number of works displayed by selecting a
          specific file collection (series) or enter search terms such as the
          title. Please note that the file browser may need some time to load and
          to update. </li>
        <li> Click the work that has the desired source description to
          show a list of its sources.<br>
            <img src="../images/manual/external_source_browser.png" alt="Source browser" class="illustration"> </li>
        <li>Click the source you want to link to. This will close the
          source browser. In the list of sources, you will see a "Go to linked
          resource" icon <img src="../images/go_to_link.png" alt="Got to linked resource"> on the source, indicating that
            this is a reference to a source description kept in an external file.
            Clicking it will close the file you are working on and open the file
            containing the link target for editing instead. A warning is displayed
            to remind you that you are about to open another file.<br>
              <img src="../images/manual/external_source_list_view.png" alt="External source as shown in the source list" class="illustration"><br>
                When creating a reference to an external source, a copy of the source's
                title is placed in your file for your information. This title does not
                update automatically if you change the source title in the linked file.
                Therefore, an update button <img src="../images/update.png" alt="Update"> is provided next to the source link's title to
                  let you update the title if necessary. </li>
        <li> In the HTML preview, an external source will be displayed
          exactly as if the source description had been entered in the file
          itself. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="important">
        <li>Be aware that files using references to external sources are not entirely
          self-contained, i.e. the source information in your file is dependent
          on having to access the referenced file, and the application using the
          file must be capable of handling this reference in order to retrieve
          all source information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Copying source descriptions from another file</h3>
      <p>Instead of referring to a source description contained in another file, you may want to copy 
        the external source description into the current file. This is convenient if you need to change something in the 
        source description in order to adapt it to the current file. </p>
      <p>To copy a source, simply choose "Copy from external source" instead of "Add link to external source"
      from the source adding menu. This places an independent copy of the external source description in your 
      current file, which can be freely edited.</p>
