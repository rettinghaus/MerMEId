MerMEId
=======

MerMEId is a system for the editing, handling, and (pre-)viewing of music
metadata, based on the the [Music Encoding
Initiative](http://www.music-encoding.org/) (MEI)  XML schema. From the 9
October 2013 MerMEId now supports MEI 2013.

MerMEId is developed at the [Danish Centre for Music Publication](http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/dcm/index.html) (DCM) both for
the production of thematic catalogues of works and for organizing source- and
work-related information during the preparation of scholarly editions of
music. Read more at the
[project](http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/dcm/projekter/mermeid.html) and
[demo](http://labs.kb.dk/editor/) websites.
[Recent changes](http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/dcm/projekter/mermeid/news.html) are described on DCM's web site

This is the source distribution. 

There is also a [binary distribution](http://labs.kb.dk/editor/mermeid.tar.bz2) (~ 8MB tar.bz2), which in addition to the source also includes jar and war files for an application server.
