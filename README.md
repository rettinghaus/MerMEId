MerMEId
=======

MerMEId is a system for the editing, handling, and (pre-)viewing of music
metadata, based on the the [Music Encoding
Initiative](http://www.music-encoding.org/) (MEI)  XML schema. From the 9
October 2013 MerMEId now supports MEI 2013.

MerMEId is developed at the [Danish Centre for Music Publication](http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/dcm/index.html) (DCM) both for
the production of thematic catalogues of works and for organizing source- and
work-related information during the preparation of scholarly editions of
music.

MerMEId is used for the creation and maintenance of [CNW Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/navigation.xq)
